# ADSB_link_budget_FIMP
This script calculates the coverage and link quality between different pairs of transmitter waypoints and receiver sites, considering the antenna height, minimum received power, azimuth, and tilt for the receiver sites. The script uses a digital elevation model (DEM) to estimate the azimuth and tilt values. The input data comes from CSV files for the waypoint coordinates and receiver site information, and a series of DEM files.
The azimuth and tilt are not available and only an estimated value was used for computation purposes.
